"""The refresh buttons: they ask for a collection, they never perform one.

This platform is the one place a user can make the integration talk to the
school's server on demand, which makes it the obvious place for a second path to
the network to appear. It must not be one. Pressing a button raises the priority
of some tiers and wakes the master tick; the scheduler still decides what is
due, the limiter still spaces the calls, and the batch lock still refuses a
second batch -- so ten presses while waiting for a grade cost one batch, not ten
(§5.1, annexe B §6). The sanction for getting that wrong applies to an IP
address and lands on the whole household, not on the press that caused it.

Three failure modes drive the tests below, and none of them shows up as an
error.

**A press that fetches.** A button calling the gateway directly would be
correct on a dashboard and invisible in the budget: the requests would not be
charged, not spaced and not shed under quiet hours. What is asserted here is
therefore negative -- pressing places no request of its own and only wakes the
heartbeat.

**A press that asks for a re-login.** ``session`` is the one tier no button may
request: forcing a re-login by hand is the gesture that can get an address
suspended (annexe B §3). The scheduler happens to hold no plan for it today, so
including it would be silently harmless -- and would stay harmless right up
until the day it was not. The exact tier list a press asks for is asserted.

**A button that greys out.** ``available`` is deliberately overridden to ignore
the base class's staleness rule. A stale integration is precisely when somebody
wants to press refresh, so inheriting that rule would hide the control at the
only moment it is useful.
