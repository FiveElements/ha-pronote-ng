"""The holiday flag, which is inferred and has to be inferred correctly.

PRONOTE publishes no holiday calendar, so ``binary_sensor.<eleve>_vacances``
reads the only evidence there is: the absence of lessons. That makes it the one
entity whose correctness depends on **how far the timetable was fetched**, and
it got two whole classes of day wrong at once.

A weekend read ``on`` because a seven-day question was asked of a two-day
window. And the last week of every long holiday read ``off`` because looking
seven days ahead found the return. Both matter for the same automation -- "no
school tomorrow, no alarm" -- and both fail it in the direction that wakes a
child at six in the morning, or fails to.

        ``async_track_point_in_time`` called with a moment already gone runs
        its callback immediately; the callback ends by arming the next
        transition, which would be computed from the same unchanged snapshot
        and be in the past again. That is not a slow loop -- it is a spin
        inside the event loop. And the case is reachable: the boundary is
        computed from a snapshot, which outlives the day it was collected on.

        "In class" depends on the time and not on the timetable: between the
        end of one lesson and the start of the next, nothing is collected and
        the answer still has to change. Without the armed transition the flag
        would be up to a full tier interval late -- fifteen minutes, which is
        most of a break.

        The master tick is unsubscribed before the clock moves, and that is
        not tidiness. A collection republishes the tier, which re-arms every
        clock-driven entity from scratch: the first draft of this test let the
        tick run, watched the state be rewritten by that collection, and
        passed -- while the transition it claimed to exercise had been
        cancelled before it could fire. Asserting that PRONOTE was not asked
        is what closes that hole: the rewrite can then only have come from the
