"""The address boundary: what a parent pasted, minus what must never be kept.

``urls.py`` is four branches of string handling, and that is exactly why it is
worth its own file. The string it trims is the one place an authentication
ticket enters this integration: establishments mail deep links, ENT portals
bounce back through single sign-on with ``?identifiant=...`` in the URL, and a
parent copying from the address bar after logging in copies whatever session
parameter is sitting there. Whatever survives ``public_url`` is stored in the
config entry, substituted into repair-issue placeholders -- written to
``.storage`` and rendered in the Repairs panel -- and written into the
diagnostics download, the file users are asked to attach to a public issue
(§8.2). A regression here is not a cosmetic one: it leaks a credential into a
file the user is instructed to publish.

The second promise is the opposite of the first, and just as load-bearing:
nothing here may *refuse* an address. A parent who can see a URL in their own
browser must be able to paste it; when it cannot be parsed the login fails with
the server's own message, which is a better diagnosis than anything this module
could invent. So every unparseable, scheme-less or plain-nonsense input has an
assertion below that it comes back unchanged rather than emptied or raised on.

Deliberately free of ``REQUIRES_HASS``: this is pure string code with no Home
Assistant import anywhere in its reach, so it must run on a contributor's
Windows checkout too -- where ``test_config_flow.py``, which owns the *flow*
half of the same promise, is skipped in its entirety.
