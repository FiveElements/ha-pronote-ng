"""The one blocking login, and the classification that is its real content.

This module was at 0 % coverage, which is indefensible for the file that
handles credentials: it is the only place a password, a QR payload and a
four-digit PIN are all in scope at once, and it is the file that decides what
the user is told when a login fails.

**The six ``except`` arms are the module.** Five of the six exception types
``probe_account`` catches are subclasses of the sixth:

    PronoteAPIError
    ├── MFAError
    ├── ENTLoginError
    ├── BootstrapUnavailable      (this project's own)
    └── CryptoError
        └── QRCodeDecryptError

So the arms are not six independent cases -- they are one ordered chain, and
every one of them would still *catch* if it were moved to the bottom. Reordering
two lines therefore changes nothing that a type checker, a linter or a smoke
test would notice, and everything about what the user reads: a QR code that
failed to decrypt would say "check your password", and a school whose server is
down would say the same. ``test_the_order_of_the_arms_is_load_bearing`` is the
test that holds that line, and it asserts the subclass relationships explicitly
rather than leaving the reader to look them up in upstream.

Nothing here needs Home Assistant. ``probe_account`` is synchronous by design
-- constructing a ``pronotepy`` client *is* a network login, so the whole module
exists to be handed to ``async_add_executor_job`` -- which is why this file
carries no ``REQUIRES_HASS`` marker and runs on Windows as well as in CI.

The one seam mocked is ``hardened_client.build_client``, imported by
``probe_account`` at call time and therefore patchable on the module. Everything
above it runs for real: the mode mapping, the ENT resolution, the shape reading,
the credential export, and the ``finally`` that closes the client.
