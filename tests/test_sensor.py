"""The sensor attributes a dashboard actually reads.

Most of this platform is a table of descriptions, and a table is not worth a
test per row. What is worth testing is the handful of places where the shape of
an attribute set -- not its value -- is what a card depends on, because those
are the failures that reach a parent as a blank tile with no error anywhere.

Two of them live here.

**A menu says whether there is a menu.** The attributes were absent entirely on
a day the canteen published nothing, so a template reading ``main_meal`` got
``None`` -- exactly what it gets before the tier has ever run. "No lunch today"
and "we have not looked yet" are different sentences to say to a parent, and
with no key to read there was no way to say either.

**A homework description is prose.** ``descriptif`` is HTML, and a card can
neither print it nor inject it.
