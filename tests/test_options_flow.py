"""The settings pages, which were the largest untested block in the flow.

Three sections and a live cost estimate. The estimate is the reason this file
matters more than a form test usually would: annexe B §7 requires the page to
show what the entered values will cost, computed by the *same* function that
produced the numbers in the annexe. A setting whose consequence you cannot see
gets set at random, and the consequence here is measured in requests against a
child's school account -- against a server whose one sanction applies to an IP
address.

Two failure modes drive the tests below, and neither is visible by reading the
code.

**A default outside its own field's range.** Every number field is built from
`const.OPTION_RANGES`, and every field also carries the documented default as
its `default=`. Nothing checks that the second is inside the first. The forms
are therefore submitted back *as displayed*: voluptuous validates the defaults
against the selectors that produced them, so a default that drifted out of
range fails here rather than on a user's screen.

**A section that resets the sections it does not show.** `_save` merges into the
stored options precisely because each page shows a subset. Replacing instead of
merging silently reverts every setting the user did not have on screen, which
is the kind of bug that is only noticed weeks later, as an unexplained change
in request volume.
