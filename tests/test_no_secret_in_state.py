"""The one test §8.2 asks for by name: run a full cycle, then hunt the secrets.

The design keeps secrets out of the state machine by construction -- the iCal
URL, the identity block and the PDF link are ``SupportsResponse.ONLY`` service
results, and nothing stores them. But "by construction" is an argument, and
arguments do not survive refactors. This module is the thing that does: it sets
the integration up with known sentinel secrets, runs a real collection cycle,
and then sweeps everything a user could hand to somebody else.

Four surfaces, because they leak differently:

* **states and attributes** -- the recorder writes them to a database that goes
  into every backup, and they are visible in screenshots;
* **the diagnostics download** -- the file users are explicitly asked to attach
  to public issues;
* **service responses** -- the one place a secret is *allowed*, so what is
  checked here is that it appears in exactly that one place and nowhere else;
* **the log** -- captured at ``DEBUG``, which is what a user turns on before
  reporting a bug.

The sentinels are deliberately implausible strings rather than realistic ones.
A test that searched for a realistic-looking token would tempt somebody to
paste a real one in, and this file is committed to a public repository.
