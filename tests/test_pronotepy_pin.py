"""The ``pronotepy`` pin: where it is declared, and when upstream moves past it.

This file protects a mechanism that exists because of one morning. Every login
against a school failed with a ``CryptoError`` that ``pronotepy`` reports as
"probably the qr code has expired", so the QR code is where the search went.
The cause was that the establishment's PRONOTE server had moved to 26.2.5 and
the pin was one release behind the upstream fix -- a release published six days
earlier, whose commit subject was literally *"fix compatibility with PRONOTE
2026.2.5.6"*. Nothing in the repository was watching PyPI, so nothing said so.

``scripts/pronotepy_pin.py`` is what says so now, by proposing the bump as a
pull request. The defects these tests stop from returning are all silent ones:

* a pin restated instead of read -- the version is already in two files, and a
  watcher carrying its own copy proposes a bump from a version nobody ships;
* the two declarations drifting apart. ``manifest.json`` is what Home Assistant
  installs on a user's instance and ``requirements_test.txt`` is what the suite
  runs against, so a divergence means the corrections in ``hardened_client.py``
  are verified against a library nobody has -- and a bump that moved only one
  of them would be worse than no bump at all;
* a comparison that is wrong in either direction: proposing a release older
  than the pin is noise, and missing a newer one is the outage above;
* a report that arrives without the upstream commit subjects, which is the only
  part of it that ended the investigation;
* a proposal presented as ready to merge. ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` §5 requires every
  divergence in ``hardened_client.py`` to be re-read against the new version,
  and no gate can discharge that.

Offline by construction. Every network call in the module under test is a
callable parameter, and every test here passes a dictionary in its place: the
suite blocks sockets, and a test of a version watcher that needed PyPI to be up
would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this repository.
