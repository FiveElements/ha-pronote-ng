"""The quality-scale inventory must name every rule, with a usable status.

Home Assistant grades Core integrations against a fixed list of rules
(developers.home-assistant.io, integration quality scale). This repository is
a custom integration, so it cannot display a bronze/silver/gold/platinum
badge, but ``quality_scale.yaml`` is how a reviewer — or a future Core
submission — sees what is done, exempt, or still open.

A file that silently drops a rule, or that marks an exemption without saying
why, is how an inventory goes stale. This test needs no Home Assistant: it
reads YAML.
