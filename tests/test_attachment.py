"""Serving a homework document, and never publishing PRONOTE's address for it.

This file guards one rule and one cost.

**The rule.** A file's PRONOTE address is
``FichiersExternes/<hex>/<name>?Session=<h>`` where the hex segment is the
document's identifier encrypted with the session's own AES key and IV. It opens
the document with no credentials and it dies with the session, so it must not
reach a state, an attribute, the recorder or a diagnostics download -- the rule
§8.2 established for the iCal URL. What is published is a signed path to this
integration's own view, which relays the bytes.

**The cost.** The download is the one fetch in the whole integration that does
not go through ``ClientBase.post``, so the limiter cannot see it unless the
caller declares it. A missing declaration would spend budget invisibly, which
is the class of defect this project exists to prevent (§11.1).
