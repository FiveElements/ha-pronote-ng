"""The translation catalogues, and the file Home Assistant refuses silently.

§10.10 makes this suite blocking in CI, and the reason is that every failure
mode here is invisible until a user hits it:

* a ``translation_key`` with no entry shows the raw key in the interface --
  ``nickname`` where a name should be;
* a key present in ``strings.json`` and missing from ``fr.json`` is invisible to
  ``hassfest``, which validates structure, not coverage;
* and ``services.yaml`` is validated by Home Assistant at load time, which on
  failure logs **one** line and serves ``{}`` -- so the services appear in the
  UI with no fields at all, and nothing in the log says why. That is how eighteen
  selectors sat two spaces too far left for as long as they did.

So the catalogues are checked three ways: against Home Assistant's own schema,
against the code that references them, and against each other.
