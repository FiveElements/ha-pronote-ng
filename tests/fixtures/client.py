"""A fake pronotepy client: canned responses in, recorded posts out.

Deliberately **not** a ``MagicMock``. Two of the defects this suite exists to
prevent are invisible to a mock:

* ``identity()`` must post through ``communication.post`` with an explicit
  ``ressource``, not through ``client.post`` -- which stamps the account
  holder as ``membre`` and, on a parent account, returns the *parent's* birth
  date and INE number under the child's device. A mock accepts both calls
  identically; this class records which one was used and with what signature.
* the cost each tier declares to the limiter must match the number of requests
  it actually places. ``posts`` is the ground truth for that, and
  ``test_tiers.py`` compares it against ``GatewayResult.calls``.

Everything is served from :mod:`tests.fixtures.protocol`, so a test that wants
a degenerate response overrides one function name and leaves the rest alone.
