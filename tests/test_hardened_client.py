"""The hardening itself: the four upstream defects, held down by assertions.

``hardened_client.py`` is the only module in this integration whose reason to
exist is another library's behaviour. Nothing in it is a feature; every line is
a countermeasure, and a countermeasure with no test is indistinguishable from a
line somebody added by mistake. That is what this file is for.

Three things are asserted here that no other test file can see:

* **the timeout exists at all.** ``grep -rn timeout`` over pronotepy returns
  nothing, so the only thing standing between a half-open socket and a
  permanently held ``asyncio.Lock`` is ``_TimeoutSession.request`` putting a
  default in ``kwargs``. It is two lines, and if either one goes the whole
  integration degrades into §5.4's staleness regime with no error anywhere.
* **the bootstrap verdict is honest.** Upstream decides an address is banned
  with ``if "IP" in html`` -- two capitals anywhere in the page. The test that
  a page saying "Espace IP" still parses is the only thing that keeps that
  check from creeping back in.
* **the period registry does not leak.** ``Period.instances`` is a mutable
  class attribute, global to the process, never cleared, and every period in it
  pins a client, a session and a socket pool. The interesting case is not the
  happy path but the one the module documents at length: the constructor raised,
  ``attach`` never ran, and the ``finally`` has to sweep by difference.

**Nothing here touches the network, and nothing here can.** Two seams are
replaced and they are the only two that would: ``requests.Session.request``, on
the base class, so ``_TimeoutSession`` can be watched without a socket; and
``pronotepy.Client.__init__``, because -- as the module docstring says --
constructing a pronotepy client *is* a login. ``_Communication.__init__`` and
``dataClasses.Period`` are used for real: neither opens a connection.

The ``pronotepy`` logger is never enabled, at any level, in any test here. It
writes the hex of every request at DEBUG, credentials included. The one
``caplog`` assertion in this file names this integration's own logger
explicitly for that reason.

No Home Assistant: every function under test is synchronous and takes its
collaborators as arguments, so this file carries no ``REQUIRES_HASS`` marker
and runs on Windows as well as in CI.

# that would show the `Identification` response shares a logger with
# `pronoteAPI` line 139, which writes the hex of every request body,
# credentials included. Turning that on to read one boolean writes a parent's
# token into a file they are then invited to attach to a public issue (§8.2).
#
# So the client reads the response it already holds. What it logs is the three
# values that decide whether the login can possibly succeed, and nothing else.
