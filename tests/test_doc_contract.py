"""Facts the documentation repeats, pinned to the one place that knows them.

A list that lives in three files diverges in two of them. This suite exists
because that already happened and was paid for: ``LESSON_EVENT_TYPES`` grew
``lesson_restored`` and ``lesson_status_changed``, and the reference tables
went on announcing four types for long enough that a code comment, an annexe
row and an architecture note all disagreed at once. The argument in each was
still right, which is what makes the divergence expensive -- a reader
reconciles a true claim with a stale list and concludes the list.

The rule these tests encode is narrow on purpose. They do not check prose, and
they do not check that the documentation is *good*; they check that a set the
code owns is reproduced exactly where the documentation reproduces it. Adding a
seventh event type must fail here, in the same commit, rather than being
noticed on a dashboard months later.

    Annexe A is the catalogue a reader consults to learn what exists, and

    ``_moyennes`` that is ``_moyennes_par_matiere``, an ``_etat_limiteur``
    that is ``_etat_du_limiteur``, a ``bride`` that is ``collectes_bridees``
    and moved device on top. That defect is invisible in the worst way. Home
    Assistant does not reject an unknown entity id in an automation: the
    trigger simply never fires, and a reader who copied the catalogue
    concludes the integration is broken.

    The check runs over the **whole** ``entity`` map of ``fr.json``, not over
    ``sensor.py``'s two tuples: the translations are already keyed by domain,
    so buttons, binary sensors and the account's own entities cost nothing
    extra to cover -- and five of the eleven lived precisely outside those
    tuples.

    Names are looked up in French and transliterated by Home Assistant's own
    ``slugify`` rather than by a local re-implementation, because the accent
    handling is exactly where this project's two repositories have already
    disagreed once. Re-implementing it here would test the guess.

    Only the presence of the suffix in backticks is asserted -- not the prose,
    not the attribute columns. The reverse direction is deliberately not
    checked: the annexe legitimately mentions per-period variants and other
    non-translated identifiers, and an heuristic for those would become a list
