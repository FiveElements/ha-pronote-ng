"""The declared Home Assistant floor, and the four places that repeat it.

A version floor is a promise made to somebody at install time: HACS reads
``hacs.json`` and refuses the integration on an older instance. The promise is
only worth something if the number is *exercised*, which is why
``requirements_test.txt`` pins the plugin release carrying exactly that Home
Assistant version rather than a merely recent one -- and why raising the floor
has twice been done by running the target socle instead of editing the number.
Both times the run found a product defect no gate could see: ``via_device``,
removed in favour of ``via_device_id``, which killed entity loading on six
platforms out of seven; and a tenfold amplification of refresh requests.

The problem this module addresses is the other half of that: the number is
written down in **nineteen** files. ``hacs.json`` declares it, the pin encodes
it, ``validate.yml``'s gated row repeats it, and sixteen blueprints each carry
a ``min_version``. Nothing made them agree. A blueprint left at the old floor
imports happily onto an instance the integration cannot run on, and the
failure surfaces as an automation whose entities do not exist -- which reads as
a broken blueprint rather than an unsupported Home Assistant.

Deliberately offline and free of any Home Assistant import: this file is about
what the repository *claims*, so it must run everywhere the suite runs,
including on the Windows half that has no test harness. What the repository
claims and what CI actually installs are tied together in ``validate.yml``
instead, by a step that reads ``homeassistant.const.__version__`` back after
the pinned install.
