"""The three calendars, and the window query nothing exercised.

``async_get_events`` is what a dashboard calls every time a user pans the
calendar card, and it was covered by no test at all -- neither its window
arithmetic nor the promise its docstring makes, that it answers *from memory
only*. That promise is the load-bearing one: a calendar that fetched on pan
would be a second path to the network, outside the limiter's monopoly
(annexe B §6), driven by how often somebody drags a card.
