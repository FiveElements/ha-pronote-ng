"""A pair of simulated clocks, because the code under test takes two.

``RateLimiter``, ``FetchScheduler`` and ``SessionManager`` all accept a
monotonic ``clock`` and a wall-clock ``now`` as constructor arguments rather
than reaching for ``time.monotonic`` and ``dt_util.now`` themselves. That is
the seam this module drives: a test advances time by an hour in one statement,
with no ``freezegun`` and no sleeping, and every branch that depends on elapsed
time becomes reachable.

The two clocks advance **together** by default, which is the realistic case.
Tests that need them to disagree -- an NTP correction stepping the wall clock
backwards while the monotonic clock does not move -- move them separately, and
that asymmetry is exactly what makes ``_roll_day``'s backwards branch testable.
