"""Device triggers, conditions and actions -- the surface §2.3 is about.

This is what the project is *for*: "when a lesson is cancelled, for this child"
has to be one card in the automation editor, not a Jinja template over an event
bus. Which makes the failure mode of this layer particularly nasty -- a trigger
that never attaches, or a condition that is never offered, produces no error
anywhere. The automation simply stops firing, and the user concludes the
integration is broken without a single line in the log.

Two of those had actually happened, and each has a test here:

* every condition whose key contains an underscore was silently absent from
  the editor, because the entity key was extracted with ``rpartition("_")`` --
  which answers ``day`` for ``school_day``. Eight of the ten conditions were
  invisible, and the two that survived were the two single-word keys;
* the write actions are gated on the option, but a hand-written automation must
  still be refused by the service rather than by the editor's filtering.
