"""The download users are told to attach to a public issue.

``test_no_secret_in_state.py`` already holds the *config entry* half: no token,
no password, no PIN, no deep link. This file holds the half that was untested,
and it is the half that touches the school data itself -- the **per-device**
diagnostics, which walks every tier's latest snapshot.

The promise there is narrower and easier to break. A tier snapshot holds
lessons, grades, teachers' comments and message bodies; the file is supposed to
report only its *shape*: when it was fetched, what it cost, how many items it
holds. Nothing in the type system says so, `async_redact_data` cannot help --
there are no known key names to strip, the content *is* the payload -- and one
plausible, well-meant change ("include a sample so we can see the format")
turns a bug report into a disclosure of a child's timetable.

So the central test here does not check a list of forbidden keys. It reads the
strings the fixtures actually put in the live snapshots and asserts that none of
them comes back out: whatever a future payload happens to contain, that is what
must not be in the file.

The second thing asserted is the distinction between **absent** and **empty**,
which this integration is built on. An empty collection is a fact -- no homework
this week -- and it must be reported as `0`, not omitted; a *missing* attribute
must be omitted rather than reported as `0`, because that is a protocol change
and it has to be visible as one.
