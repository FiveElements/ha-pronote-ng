"""The profile photo, whose cost must not scale with dashboard renders.

``async_image`` was the largest untested surface in the package: nineteen of
``image.py``'s statements, including every branch that decides whether a
request is placed. That matters more than its size suggests, because this is
the one entity Home Assistant asks for again on *every* render of a card --
so a caching mistake here does not cost one request, it costs one per viewer
per refresh, against a daily cap of a few thousand.
