"""Login accounting that has to outlive one config entry object.

Two things in this integration are longer-lived than a ``PronoteAccount``, and
both were lost because they lived on one.

**The punitive state must survive a set-up retry.** ``PronoteAccount`` builds
its own :class:`~.ratelimit.RateLimiter` in ``__init__``, so every attempt at
``async_setup_entry`` got a brand-new one. Home Assistant retries a
``ConfigEntryNotReady`` with a backoff capped at eighty seconds, so an
establishment down for a weekend produced a fresh limiter -- with its hour-long
bootstrap hold, its credentials hold and its exponential backoff all reset --
every eighty seconds for sixty-one hours. That is thousands of logins against a
configured ceiling of twenty-four a day, with ``calls_today`` reporting five,
because each reporter was a different object. The limiter's state is therefore
handed across set-up attempts through ``hass.data``.

**The configuration flow's logins have to be counted too.** The flow's probe
went straight to ``build_client``: no spacing, no bucket, no daily counter, and
-- the part that matters -- no failed-login guard. A user retyping a password
into the re-authentication form could try it as often as they liked, which is
precisely the one gesture that gets an address suspended (annexe B §3.1). Flow
logins now go through a guard held here.

Nothing here is persisted to disk. Monotonic timestamps are only meaningful
within one process, and a hold that survived a restart would be a hold nobody
could explain.
