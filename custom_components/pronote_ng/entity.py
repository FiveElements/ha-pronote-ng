"""Shared entity base: device, availability, staleness, translation.

Two behaviours are load-bearing here.

**Staleness rather than unavailability (§5.4, §2.5).** An entity becomes
``unavailable`` only if it never had data, or if the last snapshot has aged past
``stale_after`` times its tier's interval. In between it keeps its value and
flags its age. A ``numeric_state`` trigger on an entity that goes
``unavailable`` and comes back fires spuriously, so keeping the last known value
and marking it dated is safer than admitting ignorance every ten minutes.

**Clock-driven re-evaluation (annexe A §3.1).** Entities whose state depends on
the *time* and not only on the data -- "in class", "absent right now", "next
lesson", "wake-up" -- schedule a point-in-time callback at their next known
transition. Without it they change state at their tier's pace, up to fifteen
minutes late, which on a wake-up sensor removes the entire point of the sensor.

    returning ``False``, and a property beats the ``_attr_`` fallback it shadows

    collect, which is once every session cadence and not at all while a tier is
    failing. That is how ``sensor.<account>_prochaine_collecte`` came to publish
    an instant forty minutes old, and how the "throttled" flag -- the entity
