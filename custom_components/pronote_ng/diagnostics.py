"""The diagnostics download, and what is absent from it by construction.

Redaction is a safety net here, not the mechanism. The mechanism is that the
secrets never enter a snapshot in the first place: the iCal URL, the identity
block and the timetable PDF link are ``SupportsResponse.ONLY`` service results
(§8.2), so there is no state, no attribute and no runtime field holding them
for this file to find.

What *is* in the config entry -- the token, the username, the UUID, the client
identifier -- is redacted explicitly, and the child identifiers are replaced by
a truncated fingerprint rather than removed. A fingerprint is still useful in a
bug report ("both children show the same tier failing") while handing nobody
the material to replay a session (annexe A §7).
