"""Binary sensors: the yes/no facts, re-evaluated when the clock says so.

Every sensor here answers a question with two answers, so a state trigger works
directly. What makes them non-trivial is that most of them depend on the *time*
and not only on the data: "in class" stops being true when the lesson ends,
"school day" flips at midnight, "absence in progress" is a window. Bound to
their tier's cadence they would be up to fifteen minutes wrong, so each one
declares its next transition instant and is re-evaluated there with
``async_track_point_in_time`` (annexe A §3.1).

Three "twins" the first draft had -- ``devoirs_a_faire``,
``actualites_non_lues`` and ``messages_non_lus`` -- are deliberately absent.
Each one only restated ``> 0`` of a numeric sensor that already exists, and a
``numeric_state`` trigger above zero says the same thing without a second
entity to keep consistent (annexe A §3.1).
