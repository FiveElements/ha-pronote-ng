"""ha-pronote-ng -- a Home Assistant PRONOTE integration built for automations.

The directing objective is in ``docs/SPECIFICATION.md`` §1: make automations on
PRONOTE data simple to write. Every structural choice here follows from it, and
the success criterion is precise -- **any ordinary school automation must be
writable without a Jinja template.**

Set-up order matters. The account logs in once, learns its own shape (children,
periods, current period), and only then are the platforms forwarded: an entity
that does not know which child it belongs to has no stable ``unique_id``, and
§2.4 makes identifier stability a guarantee rather than an aspiration.

    referencing ``pronote_ng.mark_homework_done`` was unvalidatable whenever the

    a device it cannot place. So the action is always present and fails with a
    reason when no account is loaded, instead of being absent and failing with
    "action not found".

    Nothing is unregistered on unload, deliberately. Removing an action because
