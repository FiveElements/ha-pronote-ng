"""Session ownership: one thread, one lock, and a measured reconnection policy.

Two concerns live here, and they are related.

**Serialisation.** The protocol numbers requests with an encrypted counter --
``_Communication.post`` encrypts ``request_number``, writes it into the URL path
as well, and advances by two. Two concurrent calls on one session desynchronise
that counter and break the session. ``hass.async_add_executor_job`` uses a
shared thread pool, so two jobs started together *are* concurrent; hence one
single-worker executor and one ``asyncio.Lock`` per config entry (§3.2).

The lock covers more than the call. ``set_child()`` **mutates** the client by
rewriting ``parametres_utilisateur["dataSec"]["data"]["ressource"]``, which is
the same slot ``Client.lessons()`` reads to build its request body. So the
atomic unit of work is ``(child, tier)`` -- never ``tier`` alone, or a parent
account publishes one child's timetable under the other child's entities,
silently.

It also has to cover the *choice of client*. A second gate, ``_gate``, is held
across "pick a client, wait for budget, call, retry" as one unit. Without it a
service invoked during a tick captured a client, awaited its spacing, and woke
up to post on a client that a concurrent ``Erreur.G = 10`` retry had already
closed -- producing a spurious expiry sample, a third login, and a failed tier
from a single overlap.

**Reconnection.** Specification v1 closed the session between batches on the
strength of a cost model that was wrong three times over (annexe B §5.1). The
strategy here is lazy: keep the session, and log in again only when the server
says it expired.

Its defensibility rests on a dominance argument, and the argument has to be
stated precisely because a loose version of it is false. Lazy is not free in
the bad case: if the establishment's inactivity timeout is *shorter* than the
fastest tier's interval, every batch spends one wasted request discovering the
session is dead before logging in -- one request per batch worse than
per-batch, not equal to it. What bounds that is the degradation: three
consecutive expiries make this module conclude the timeout is short and
reconnect eagerly, so the waste is three requests, once, and then one a day
from the probe that keeps the conclusion falsifiable. Under that bound lazy is
never meaningfully worse for any value of the unknown parameter, and it is
dramatically better for the common one.

The degradation only works if a success does not casually undo it. Lifting the
conclusion requires *counter-evidence* -- a session that survived an inactivity
gap at least as long as the shortest one that previously expired -- and not
merely the next call after a fresh login succeeding, which it always does.

#:
#: 10 is the documented one and was for a long time the only one here. **8 is

#: "La page a expiré !" -- the same statement in different words. It has to be
#: recognised by number, because ``pronotepy`` has no entry for 8 in
#: ``error_messages`` and therefore renders it as ``Unknown error from
#: pronote: 8 | La page a expiré !``. That string is a *message*, not a
#: classification; the code is on the exception either way
#: (``pronoteAPI.py:191`` attaches ``pronote_error_code`` for every code but
#: 22).
#:
#: Treating 8 as an unclassified refusal cost the live instance seven hours of
#: frozen data, and the shape of that failure is the argument for this set
#: existing at all. The session was dead server-side while
#: ``SessionManager.is_open`` still answered ``True``, so no branch ever
#: reached :meth:`SessionManager._reopen`; every attempt failed, each failure
#: deepened the exponential backoff, and no call could succeed to reset it.
#: That is not a pause that resolves -- it is a well, and only a restart got
#: the instance out of it. An unrecognised expiry code is therefore not a
#: cosmetic gap: it is a permanent outage with a plausible-looking limiter
#: state (``backoff``) on top of it.

#: reason :data:`SESSION_EXPIRED_CODES` is not the whole fix. A held client is
#: only ever evidence that a login once succeeded; after hours of silence it
#: is a belief, and the cheapest correct move is to stop holding it.
#:
#: One hour, derived rather than guessed: the default login cap is 24 a day,
#: which is one an hour, so a ceiling at or above 3600 s can never be the
#: reason that cap is reached. And it costs nothing in normal operation --
#: this fires lazily, at the next unit of work, so a quiet-hours night of
#: eight idle hours provokes exactly one extra login at 06:00 rather than one
#: per hour. A server whose real timeout is *shorter* than this is a different
#: problem, already handled by the expiry counter and the degradation to
#: ``PER_BATCH``.

PROBE_INTERVAL_SECONDS: Final = 86400.0

#: Inactivity gaps below this are not recorded as lifetime samples. The first
#: call after a login can fail with ``Erreur.G = 10`` for reasons that have
#: nothing to do with a timeout -- a server restart, a session the establishment
#: invalidated -- and ``observed_minutes`` is a *minimum*, so one such sample
#: would pin the measured lifetime near zero for the rest of the run and
#: falsify both the diagnostic sensor and the options-page estimate.
MIN_LIFETIME_SAMPLE_SECONDS: Final = 60.0
