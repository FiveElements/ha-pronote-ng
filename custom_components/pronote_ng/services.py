"""Services: the on-demand actions, and the secrets that never become states.

Two rules shape this file.

**A secret is returned, never stored (§8.2).** The iCal URL, the identity and
the timetable PDF link are ``SupportsResponse.ONLY`` services. The iCal URL in
particular grants read access to a child's whole timetable with no username and
no password; as a state it would land in the recorder database, in every
backup, in screenshots and in bug reports. As a service response it exists for
the length of one script run. That is also why it is absent from the
diagnostics download -- there is nothing to redact, because nothing is kept.

**A write is off by default (§8.3).** Ticking a homework item, marking news read
and sending a message all change what the establishment sees. They are refused
unless the user turned write operations on, and refused with an explanation
rather than ignored.

Every call goes through the rate limiter and the serial executor like any
collection: a service is not a dispensation. ``refresh`` in particular does not
call anything itself -- it raises the priority of the requested tiers and lets
the next master tick serve them, so a button mashed ten times still costs one
batch (§5.1).
