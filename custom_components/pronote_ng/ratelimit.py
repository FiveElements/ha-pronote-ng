"""The rate limiter: three layers for calls, two counters for logins.

PRONOTE publishes no rate limit. It applies sanctions, and they do not punish
the same gesture (annexe B §1):

============================ ===================================== ============
Sanction                     Trigger                               Severity
============================ ===================================== ============
Broken session               two concurrent calls desynchronise the immediate,
                             encrypted request counter              recoverable
``Erreur.G = 10``            session expired through inactivity     benign
``Erreur.G = 25``            too many *authorization* requests      wait; do not
                                                                   insist
Address suspension           repeated failed logins                 costly, and
                                                                   undocumented
============================ ===================================== ============

Only the last one really hurts, and it does not target calls -- it targets
*failed logins*. A limiter counting only requests would miss its target, which
is why authentication has its own accounting here.

Five properties are load-bearing, and each one exists because its absence was a
real defect found by review rather than a hypothetical:

* **admission, not retrospection.** Spacing and the token bucket are charged
  *before* the request leaves, inside an admission lock. Charged afterwards,
  two callers -- a scheduled batch and a service invoked during it -- read the
  same ``_last_call``, computed the same wait, slept it together and fired in
  the same millisecond: the desynchronised request counter of §1's first row,
  produced by the very layer meant to prevent it.
* **authentication is subject to the layers too.** A login costs five to seven
  HTTP requests, so it goes through the same admission as any call. It is only
  exempt from *shedding*, never from spacing, from the bucket, or from the
  daily counter.
* **``CRITICAL`` is genuinely unsheddable.** Its threshold is infinite, not a
  large number. ``calls_today`` has no ceiling, so any finite threshold is
  reachable -- a user who sets ``max_requests_per_day`` to its documented floor
  of 100 crosses 2.0 on the first day -- and reaching it refuses the login that
  every other tier depends on.
* **the cost asked of the bucket is the cost charged.** Asking for one token
  while charging six let ``history`` drain four times the burst capacity per
  hour with no wait, which removes exactly the smoothing §2.2 exists for.
* **every login attempt counts, successful or not.** Counting only successes
  left a failing account attempting without bound while the counter meant to
  stop it stayed at zero.

This module knows neither PRONOTE nor Home Assistant. It takes injectable
clocks and returns decisions, which is what makes it testable to 100 % with no
network and no instance (annexe B §6).
