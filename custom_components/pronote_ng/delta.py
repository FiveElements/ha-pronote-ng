"""Change detection: two rules, because one cannot do the job.

Specification v1 had a single rule -- "delta on the ``N`` identifier, never on
content". It is right for most collections and **incapable of implementing
``cours_modifie``**, which is the most useful event of the set. Two reasons,
both verified:

* a room change keeps the same ``N``, so it produces no identifier delta at
  all, and ``room_changed`` / ``teacher_changed`` would never fire;
* a replacement arrives with a fresh ``N`` while the original entry is still
  present, so it reads as an *addition* rather than a modification -- and
  ``previous_start`` / ``previous_classroom`` have no source whatsoever.

So the rule splits (§2.2.1):

**Append-only collections** -- grades, homework, news, absences, delays,
punishments, messages, evaluations -- keep the identifier rule exactly as
written. A label a teacher corrects must not wake the house up.

**The timetable** compares a whitelisted field tuple **per lesson
identifier**, over the *un*-de-duplicated week. ``memo``,
``background_color`` and lesson content are excluded, so a corrected memo
still fires nothing -- which is what the single rule was really trying to buy.

Both halves of that sentence were wrong in the first implementation, and both
were wrong in a way that produced no error at all:

* it keyed on the **slot** (day plus position in the day). Since the day is
  part of a slot key, a lesson that moved could never be seen to have moved:
  ``lesson_moved`` was structurally unreachable, while a change to the
  establishment's slot *grid* -- the bell times shifting by five minutes --
  moved ``start`` for every lesson in every slot at once and fired a
  ``lesson_moved`` for the entire week;
* it ran over the **de-duplicated** week. On a substitution PRONOTE serves the
  original entry with ``estAnnule`` set *plus* a replacement with a higher
  ``num``, and de-duplication keeps the replacement -- so the entry carrying
  the cancellation had been discarded one layer down, and the cancellation was
  unobservable.

Keying on ``N`` fixes both: a cancellation, a room change, a teacher change and
a move are all *the same entry* changing, which is exactly what an identifier
is for.

Stated generally: **delta on identity where identity is stable, on a
whitelisted subset of fields where the protocol supersedes instead of
appending.**
