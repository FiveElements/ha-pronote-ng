"""Sensors: one fact, one entity, one primitive state.

The rule of §2.1 is what this file exists to honour. Anything an automation may
want to trigger on has its own entity, whose **state** carries the fact -- a
timestamp, a number, a boolean -- and not a structure to walk. Full lists stay
available as attributes for cards; they are never the *only* route to a fact.

Two consequences show up throughout:

* a numeric sensor declares ``device_class``, ``state_class`` and a unit
  wherever they exist, so a ``numeric_state`` threshold works with no
  conversion;
* a state is an ISO-8601 aware timestamp or a number, never formatted text. A
  sensor reading ``8h30`` or ``14,5`` loses sorting, graphing, thresholds and the
  browser's locale in one stroke (§10.7).

    #:
    #: A file's ``url`` inside ``items`` is a signed address, and a signed
    #: address is a **bearer token**: anyone holding it fetches that document
    #: for twelve hours with no credentials. Written to the history database on
    #: every collection it becomes durable, and a database is copied into every
    #: backup and pasted into the occasional bug report. `PronoteEntity`
    #: already excludes ``items`` -- and now ``attachment_links`` --  through
    #: `UNRECORDED_LIST_ATTRIBUTES`, so inheriting is all this class has to do.
    #:
    #: Declaring the name here **removes** that protection. Home Assistant does
    #: not union the sets up a hierarchy: ``Entity.__init_subclass__`` computes
    #: ``_entity_component_unrecorded_attributes | cls._unrecorded_attributes``,
    #: and the right-hand side resolves by ordinary attribute lookup, so a
    #: subclass declaration shadows the parent's instead of extending it.
    #: v0.0.22 added ``frozenset({"attachment_links"})`` here believing it
    #: additive; the effect was to hand the recorder every list attribute of
    #: every sensor -- ``items``, ``lessons``, ``subjects``, the menu fields,
    #: ``messages``, ``address`` -- plus ``fetched_at``. The signed addresses
    #: were then measured in the history of a live instance, which is how the
    #: mistake surfaced; the database bloat came free with it.
    #:
    #: Two lessons worth keeping. The recorder filter is **top-level only**
    #: (``recorder.db_schema.shared_attrs_bytes_from_event`` is a comprehension
    #: over ``state.attributes.items()``), so a nested address is covered only
    #: by excluding the key that contains it. And the diagnostics download was
    #: once argued safe because "these values are never attributes" (see
    #: `diagnostics.py`) -- true until this attribute existed. A property of an
    #: architecture stops holding when the architecture changes.
