"""Device triggers: the automation editor's half of §2.3.

Without this file, "when a lesson is cancelled for Camille" is something a user
has to build out of an event entity and a state condition. With it, they pick
the child's device and choose the trigger from a list. That is the difference
between an integration that *can* be automated and one that is designed to be.

Every trigger here is the same underlying mechanism as the ``event`` entities:
the account fires one bus signal per detected change, after the snapshots are
published. This module simply exposes that signal through the device-automation
contract, filtered on the entry, the child and the event type -- so the trigger
fires once, for the right child, and its ``trigger.event.data.attributes``
carries the change (annexe A §4).
