#: The mark shown at the top of the first screen of the configuration flow.
#:
#: A URL and not a path -- though not because the local brand folder goes
#: unread. Since Home Assistant 2026.3 a custom integration's own ``brand/``
#: directory is served by the frontend through the brands proxy API
#: (``/api/brands/integration/{domain}/{image}``), and those local images take
#: precedence over the ``home-assistant/brands`` repository; so
#: ``custom_components/pronote_ng/brand/`` is read by the frontend itself on a
#: recent instance, not only by the HACS validation.
#:
#: The mechanism is version-gated, and the gate is now closed behind us:
#: ``hacs.json`` declares a floor of 2026.8.0, which is above the 2026.3 that
#: introduced the proxy, so **every supported instance serves the local
#: folder**. There is therefore no longer a version on which this constant is
#: the only way to put the mark on that screen -- the argument that justified
#: it has expired.
#:
#: What still holds it here is one unverified claim: that the config-flow
#: dialog's own header consumes the proxy. The proxy's existence does not
#: establish that this particular screen uses it, and if it does, the markdown
#: image below renders the logo a second time. So the removal is pending a
#: visual check of the first step of the flow on a 2026.8-or-newer instance,
#: and not pending anything else. When that check comes back positive, this
#: constant, its import, the ``description_placeholders`` argument in
#: ``config_flow.async_step_user`` and the ``{logo}`` placeholder in
#: ``scripts/build_translations.py`` all go together.
#:
#: Passed as a description placeholder rather than written into the translation
#: string, because hassfest rejects a URL inside one and names this as the
#: mechanism to use instead -- which is also the better shape: the address
#: lives here, in code, rather than duplicated across three catalogues.
#:
#: Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering: rendering that
#: dialog performs one outbound request to raw.githubusercontent.com, and an
#: instance with no route to GitHub shows the alt text instead of a picture.
#: Neither blocks the flow, and this screen sends nothing to PRONOTE.

#: went through unclamped.
#:
