"""Calendars: the timetable, the homework deadlines and the detentions.

The timetable calendar is where the de-duplication of §2.2.1 becomes visible.
PRONOTE returns the original lesson *and* its replacement when a slot changes,
so without the gateway keeping only the highest ``num`` per ``(date, place,
subject)`` slot the calendar shows the cancelled 10:00 maths lesson next to the
one that replaced it -- and every "am I in class" question answers twice.

``uid`` is the PRONOTE identifier, so a calendar card that re-reads a range
recognises the same event rather than duplicating it.
