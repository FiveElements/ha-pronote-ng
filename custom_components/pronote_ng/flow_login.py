"""The one blocking login the configuration flow needs, isolated.

Constructing a ``pronotepy`` client *is* a network login: ``ClientBase.__init__``
ends with ``self.logged_in = self._login()``. So this whole module is
synchronous and meant to be handed to ``async_add_executor_job`` -- calling it
from the event loop would block Home Assistant for the length of a PRONOTE
handshake (§3.2).

It lives apart from ``config_flow.py`` for a reason that is not cosmetic: the
flow must not import ``pronotepy`` at module scope, or a broken dependency turns
"the integration cannot log in" into "the integration cannot be added at all".

Nothing here is retried. A wrong password gets exactly one attempt per user
gesture, because repeatedly retrying one is what gets an address suspended, and
the suspension is undocumented and costly (annexe B §3.1).
