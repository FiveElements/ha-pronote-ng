"""The configuration and options flows.

Three ways in, because PRONOTE has three: a QR code from the mobile app,
a direct username and password, and an ENT federated login. They are not
variations of one form -- QR enrolment produces a rotating token and needs a
device UUID, credentials mode does not, and ENT needs a provider chosen from a
list -- so each gets its own step rather than one form with fields that are
sometimes ignored.

Two things here are load-bearing.

**The 2FA PIN is never stored (§8.1).** It is asked for, used for the one login
that needs it, and dropped. Everything else -- the token, the UUID, the client
identifier -- is persisted, because losing those means losing access. The
re-authentication flow exists precisely so a secret we refuse to keep can be
requested again.

**Every login here goes through the executor and the limiter.** A config flow
that logged in on the event loop would block Home Assistant for the length of a
PRONOTE handshake, and one that retried a wrong password freely would spend the
three-attempt guard rail that protects the address from suspension (annexe B
§3).
