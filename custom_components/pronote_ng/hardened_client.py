"""The hardened pronotepy client -- a prerequisite, not an option (§3.6).

Four upstream behaviours make the plain client unusable behind a rate limiter
that claims to be the only path to the network. All four are verified against
pronotepy 2.15.6.

**1. It re-authenticates behind the caller's back.** ``ClientBase.post``
catches *every* ``PronoteAPIError`` except ``ExpiredObject``, calls
``self.refresh()`` -- ``session.close()``, a GET on the HTML page,
``FonctionParametres``, ``Identification``, ``Authentification``,
``ParametresUtilisateur`` -- and then replays the call. One budgeted call can
therefore cost six network requests, so "the limiter is the only path to the
gateway" is false as written. Worse, ``Erreur.G = 25`` ("too many authorization
requests") is an ordinary ``PronoteAPIError``, so it provokes exactly the class
of request that ``G = 25`` punishes.

**2. ``ParentClient.post`` duplicates that handler without the recursion
guard.** ``ClientBase.post`` protects itself (``if self._refreshing: raise e``);
``ParentClient.post`` does not. A server erroring during ``refresh()``'s
``_login()`` yields unbounded recursion of full logins -- on a parent account,
which is this project's whole use case.

**3. ``refresh()`` silently loses the child selection.** It calls ``_login()``,
which rewrites ``parametres_utilisateur[...]["ressource"]`` with the *parent's*
resource, and ``ParentClient`` only rebuilds ``_selected_child`` in
``__init__``. After an automatic refresh, ``post()`` still stamps the right
``membre`` but ``lessons()`` sends the parent's resource in the body.

**4. There is no HTTP timeout anywhere.** ``grep -rn timeout`` over the package
returns nothing: neither the bootstrap GET nor the POSTs pass ``timeout=``. A
server that accepts the connection and never answers pins the single worker
thread for ever, the ``asyncio.Lock`` is never released, and §5.4's staleness
regime disguises a permanent deadlock as a slow network.

So: this module owns one client class whose ``post()`` never re-authenticates,
which stamps the child signature itself, and whose transport carries timeouts.
Re-login becomes the :class:`~.session.SessionManager`'s decision, counted by
the limiter -- and that is what makes ``Erreur.G = 10`` an observable, and
therefore measurable, event (§6.5).
