"""``PronoteAccount``: one per config entry, and the only thing that ticks.

The master heartbeat asks the scheduler what is due, then runs those tiers in
one session, spaced by the limiter (§5.1). Nothing else in the integration owns
a timer that reaches the network.

The order of operations inside a tick is not incidental:

1. tiers are served in priority order, because the limiter sheds by priority and
   serving out of order would drop the wrong ones (annexe B §2.4);
2. a collection that succeeds publishes its snapshot *and then* runs the delta
   detector, so an event never fires for data the entities do not yet hold;
3. a collection that is deferred moves its deadline and keeps its snapshot;
4. a collection that fails flips the coordinator's success flag and keeps its
   snapshot too -- "I know, but it is old" beats "I no longer know" on school
   data (§4.4).
