"""The child's profile photo.

Read through the gateway, under the session lock and after ``set_child``, and
never as a property. ``ClientInfo.profile_picture`` goes through
``ClientInfo._cache()``, which posts directly on ``communication`` and so
bypasses both ``ClientBase.post`` and the parent account's ``membre``
signature: read as a property from an entity, a parent account can render the
wrong child's face (annexe A §5.4).
