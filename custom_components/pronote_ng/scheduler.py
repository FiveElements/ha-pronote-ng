"""The scheduler: one master tick, tiers that carry deadlines rather than timers.

Independent timers eventually coincide and produce bursts, so there is exactly
one heartbeat. It asks which tiers are due, and the batch runs them in one
session, spaced by the rate limiter (§5.1).

A deferred tier is never abandoned: its deadline moves and it keeps its previous
snapshot, so its entities keep their value (annexe B §2.4). And reducing an
interval does not trigger an immediate collection -- the next deadline is
recomputed from the last collection, not from the moment the option changed
(§7.3), because otherwise saving the options page would fire a full batch.

Like the limiter, this module knows neither PRONOTE nor Home Assistant: it takes
an injectable clock and answers questions.
