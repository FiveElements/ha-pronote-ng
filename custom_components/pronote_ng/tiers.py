"""Per-tier collection: one place that maps a tier to its request and its DTO.

Kept apart from :mod:`.account` so the orchestration stays readable, and kept
out of :mod:`.gateway` so the gateway keeps its property: one public function per
*protocol call*, not one per displayed value (§3.3).

Each function returns the snapshot, what it cost, and the events its change
detector found. The cost is returned rather than inferred, which is what makes
the per-tier contract test of §11.1 possible -- an accidental property access
doubles the cost with nothing breaking, and that is the regression this project
exists to prevent.

    """The tier's declared priority, raised for a first collection that works.

    A tier that has never produced a snapshot is publishing `unavailable`, and
    §2.5 is explicit that an unavailable entity breaks automations rather than
    merely looking empty. So its **first** collection outranks quiet hours,
    which is the one dispensation annexe B already grants: ``CRITICAL`` is the
    priority the login itself uses, and the quiet-hours branch of
    ``RateLimiter.check`` exempts it. Without that, an instance restarted -- or
    installed -- at 23:00 showed nothing at all until 06:00 and looked broken,
    and the first collection is exactly the one a user is watching for.

    The dispensation used to be described as self-limiting because a tier that
    collects stops qualifying. True, and insufficient: **success was its only
    exit**. A tier that can never succeed stays data-less for ever, so it held
    a *standing* quiet-hours exemption. On a live instance the establishment's
    unusable teaching-staff tab was therefore the only tier awake between 22:00
    and 06:00 -- which made it the only tier able to accumulate failures, with
    no other tier's success available to reset the account's back-off. One
    broken tab became an account-wide ``backoff``, and entities it does not own
    went stale behind it.

    So the exit is now *evidence* as well as success. The argument for the
    dispensation is about a first collection that works, and it cannot survive
    the demonstration that this one does not: after
    :data:`_FIRST_COLLECTION_ATTEMPTS` failures the tier drops back to its
    declared priority and waits for 06:00 like everything else. Nothing is
    given up -- it keeps its deadline, ``mark_failed`` still floors its retry at
    a quarter of its interval, and the first success resets the counter and
    restores the dispensation for any future gap.
