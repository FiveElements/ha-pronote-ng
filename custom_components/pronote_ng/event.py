"""``event`` entities: what actually changed, as a trigger.

These exist because a state trigger cannot express "a *new* grade arrived". A
grade sensor counting 12 then 13 tells you the count moved; it does not tell
you which grade, in which subject, or with what coefficient. An ``event``
entity fires once per change and carries that change in its attributes, so the
automation reads ``trigger.event.data`` and needs no template (§2.3).

The central case is ``lesson_changed``. One entity declares four event types --
``lesson_canceled``, ``lesson_moved``, ``room_changed``, ``teacher_changed`` --
and fires **one event per changed aspect**, not one per changed lesson. A
lesson that is both moved and has its room changed produces two events, because
an automation asking "was a room changed?" must not have to inspect a payload
to find out (annexe A §4).

Delivery is deliberately indirect: the account fires a bus signal after the
snapshots are published, and these entities subscribe to it. That ordering is
the guarantee that an automation reacting to "a grade arrived" finds
``sensor.<student>_derniere_note`` already holding it (§5.1).
