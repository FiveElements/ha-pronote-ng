"""Frozen data transfer objects -- the only thing that crosses the gateway.

Nothing pronotepy produces is allowed past this boundary (SPECIFICATION.md
§3.1). Three known defects disappear by construction:

* an object read after its session closed raises ``Erreur.G = 22``;
* a lazy attribute (``Information.content``, ``Attachment.data``,
  ``Lesson.content``) calls the network at the moment it is *read*, so
  potentially from the event loop;
* an entity holding a client reference keeps the whole object graph alive,
  session included.

The concrete case worth naming: ``ClientInfo._cache()`` calls
``self._client.communication.post(...)`` directly, bypassing ``ClientBase.post``
and -- on a parent account -- the ``membre`` signature that says *which child*.
Reading ``ClientInfo.address``, ``.email``, ``.phone`` or ``.ine_number`` from
anywhere therefore fires an unbudgeted and possibly misattributed call. This
boundary is what prevents it, and that is the best justification for its
existence.

Every ``datetime`` here is timezone-aware. The conversion happens once, in the
gateway, with the establishment's timezone (§4.2).
