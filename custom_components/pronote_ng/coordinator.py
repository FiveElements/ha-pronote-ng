"""One coordinator per tier, driven by the scheduler rather than by a timer.

``update_interval`` is ``None`` on purpose: the scheduler decides what is due
and calls ``async_set_updated_data()``. An entity subscribes only to its own
tier's coordinator, so collecting the canteen menus does not rewrite the
timetable's state (§5.3).

Data is keyed by student because one config entry is one *account*, and a parent
account holds several children who share a session, a budget and an IP address
(§7.1).

        A failed collection must never overwrite a good snapshot: entities keep
        their last known value and report its age instead (§4.4, §5.4). That is
        enforced simply by this being the only writer and only ever being called
        after a success.

        The identity check is the one runtime defence against the worst silent
        failure this integration has (§7.1). ``pronotepy``'s parent client sets
        ``_selected_child = self.children[0]`` in its constructor, so a code
        path that forgets ``set_child`` raises nothing at all -- it returns the
        *first* child's data. With one child that is undetectable; with two it
        publishes one child's timetable under the other child's entities, and
        the only detector left is a parent recognising the wrong lessons on
        their dashboard. Every snapshot is stamped with the child it was
        collected for, so the mismatch can be caught here instead.

        Raised rather than dropped: the collection loop turns an exception into
        a failed tier with a repair, which keeps the previous good snapshot and
        makes the fault visible. Silently skipping it would leave the entities
        stale with no explanation, which is the failure this check exists to
