"""Device conditions: the questions an automation asks about a child.

"Only if it is a school day", "only if the child is not in class", "only if
homework is overdue". Each one maps onto a binary sensor that already exists,
so the condition is a thin, traceable wrapper over ``condition.state`` rather
than a second implementation of the predicate. Two implementations of "is it a
school day" would eventually disagree, and the disagreement would show up as an
automation that fires when its own condition card says it should not.
