"""The PRONOTE address: normalised once, on the way in.

A PRONOTE address is a plain page URL --
``https://<host>/pronote/parent.html`` -- and ``pronotepy`` appends its own
query string. Nothing this integration does needs the query string or the
fragment of what the user pasted.

What the user pastes, on the other hand, is very often not that. Establishments
mail out deep links, ENT portals bounce back through single-sign-on with a
ticket in the URL, and a parent copying from the browser's address bar after
logging in copies whatever session parameter is sitting there. Keeping that
string meant a session parameter could travel into the config entry, from there
into a repair issue's placeholders (which are written to ``.storage`` and
rendered in the Repairs panel), and from there into the diagnostics download --
the file users are asked to attach to a public issue.

So the address is trimmed at the boundary, once, and the trimmed form is the
only one that is ever stored, displayed or reported. ``url_host`` narrows it
further for the cases that only need to say *which* establishment.
