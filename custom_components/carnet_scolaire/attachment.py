"""Serving a homework document without ever publishing PRONOTE's address.

A homework attachment comes in two kinds and only one of them has an address
that means anything outside the session that fetched it (see
:class:`.models.HomeworkAttachment`). A **link** is published as-is. A **file**
is the reason this module exists.

PRONOTE's address for a file is
``FichiersExternes/<hex>/<name>?Session=<h>``, where the hex segment is the
document's identifier encrypted with the session's own AES key and IV. Two
consequences decide the whole design: it stops working when the session does,
and while it works it opens the document with no credentials at all. So it must
never reach a state, an attribute, the recorder or a diagnostics download --
the rule §8.2 established for the iCal URL.

What a dashboard gets instead is an address **Home Assistant** serves: a
signed, expiring path to the view below, which fetches the bytes through the
ordinary chokepoint -- one session, one lock, charged to the limiter -- and
relays them. That address is **not** in any attribute. The state carries a
``key`` naming the document, and ``carnet_scolaire.get_attachment_url`` mints the
signed path at the instant somebody clicks. A signed path is a bearer token,
and an attribute is the most widely readable surface Home Assistant has: every
account reads `/api/states`, automation traces keep the triggering state in
`.storage`, and the more-info dialog displays it.

Relayed and not redirected, deliberately. A 302 would put PRONOTE's address in
the browser's address bar, its history, the network tab and the log of any
proxy on the way, which is precisely the credential this module exists not to
publish. Nothing in the response body or headers carries it.

Three properties of the path are load-bearing:

**It is rooted, not absolute.** That is what :func:`async_sign_path` produces,
and it is also the only correct form: an absolute URL would make the
integration guess which host the browser arrived through, and ``get_url`` hands
the internal address to somebody connected from outside.

**It names a fingerprint, not an identifier.** A real PRONOTE identifier
carries a ``#`` -- a fragment delimiter, which would truncate the path -- and
writing one into an attribute puts it in the recorder. The fingerprint is the
same idiom ``diagnostics.py`` uses for child identifiers. It also makes the
address name a *document* rather than a position, so re-ordering between two
collections cannot serve the wrong file.

**It expires, in minutes.** Minted on click and opened at once, it has no
reason to outlive the click, so a copied address -- a link shared by mistake,
a screenshot of the browser bar -- is dead before it can be reused.

#: constraint that no longer exists: the address sat in an attribute, so it had
#: to outlive the homework tier's interval or a parent would meet a 401 on a
#: link the page was still showing. Minted by the service at the click and
#: opened immediately, it only has to survive the round trip and a slow PDF
#: viewer asking for a second range -- and every minute beyond that is a minute

#: what authorises the request -- so its only job is to name one document
#: without colliding with another on the same account. At a few dozen
#: attachments a collision is not a rounding error away from impossible, it is
#: impossible in practice, and a longer digest would only make the address
