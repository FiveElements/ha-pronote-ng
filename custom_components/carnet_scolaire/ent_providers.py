"""The ENT portals the login form offers, and how a stored name becomes a login.

A portal is persisted by **name**, because a config entry holds JSON and a
portal is a function. That name used to be resolved in three places -- the
form's option list, the flow's probe and the session's reconnection -- each
with its own ``getattr`` on ``pronotepy.ent``. They agreed only because
nothing had yet been added to one of them. This module is now the single
answer to both questions: which names exist, and what a name logs in with.

It also offers portals ``pronotepy`` does not ship working. Its ``ent.py``
carries ``enc_hauts_de_seine`` as a commented-out binding to ``_oze_ent``,
and binding it as written fails before any credential is sent: ``_oze_ent``
loads the portal's home page and looks for the Keycloak form there, but that
page is now a JavaScript application that redirects by script, so the form is
absent and the function dies on ``None.findAll``. Upstream disabled it in 2023
("Remove outdated CAS", #255) and has since declared the ENT functions
unmaintained (#335); a parent report from 2022 (#165) had already shown the
OZE fallback asking for the pupil's function where a parent needs ``TUT``.

What does work is the portal's **CAS** endpoint, and PRONOTE itself points at
it: an establishment reachable only through the portal answers every request
for ``parent.html`` -- ``?login=true`` included -- with a redirect to
``/auth/realms/<realm>/protocol/cas/login``, whose page carries a standard
Keycloak form. :func:`keycloak_cas_login` follows that redirect, submits the
form, and lets Keycloak send the browser back to PRONOTE with a ticket. It
needs nothing from the OZE API and nothing about the account's profile, which
is what made the upstream function wrong for parents.

Precedence goes to upstream: if a ``pronotepy`` release exports one of these
names, its own function is used and the local one is ignored.
