"""Stable identities for the children of one account.

PRONOTE writes a child's resource identifier as ``46#<signature>``, and that
signature is **not stable between sessions**. Three distinct values were
observed for a single pupil on a single account in one day. Because an
entity's ``unique_id`` embedded that identifier, a rotation was
indistinguishable from the arrival of a new child: a second device appeared,
a full set of entities was created against it, and the previous set was
orphaned in the registry for ever -- every dashboard, automation and helper
pointing at it dead, with nothing logged anywhere.

So the identifier the rest of the integration uses is one **we mint**, and the
mapping from PRONOTE's rotating identifier to ours is stored in the config
entry. That mapping table is the durable artefact; the key is merely what it
contains. Re-pairing on every set-up is not a migration step that runs once,
it is the normal mode of operation -- which is why it lives here rather than
in a migration.

**Why not the name.** It is the obvious alternative and it is wrong for the
same reason: an establishment corrects a spelling, a family changes name, a
school switches from ``DUPONT Marie`` to ``Marie DUPONT``. That moves the
problem rather than removing it. The name is used only as the *second* way to
recognise a record whose identifier has rotated -- never as the key.

**Why not a position in the list.** §2.4 forbids it outright, and rightly: a
sibling added or removed would renumber everybody.

This module is deliberately free of Home Assistant and of ``pronotepy``: it is
a pure function over two lists, so it can be tested exhaustively and runs in
the HA-free half of the suite.
