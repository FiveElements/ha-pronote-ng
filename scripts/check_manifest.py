"""Manifest invariants that must hold in CI.

Two of them, both from SPECIFICATION.md:

* §8.1 -- ``manifest.json`` must carry no ``loggers`` key. Setting the
  ``pronotepy`` logger to DEBUG makes ``pronoteAPI.py`` write the request
  payload in the clear, credentials included. The requirement is worth nothing
  unless something enforces it, because a ``loggers`` entry is exactly the kind
  of line someone adds while debugging and forgets to remove.
* §11.1 -- on a release, ``version`` must equal the tag. A HACS integration
  whose manifest diverges from its tag installs once and never updates again.

And one that comes from an outage rather than from the specification: the
``pronotepy`` pin is declared twice, here and in ``requirements_test.txt``, and
nothing made the two agree. ``manifest.json`` is what Home Assistant installs
on a user's instance; ``requirements_test.txt`` is what the suite runs against.
A divergence therefore means CI is green against a library nobody ships --
which matters precisely because ``hardened_client.py`` corrects
version-specific upstream behaviour, so "tested" and "installed" being
different versions makes the corrections unverified. The parser lives in
``scripts/pronotepy_pin.py``, shared with the weekly upstream watch, so the pin
is read from the repository and never restated.
