"""Fail when the documentation cites a source location that cannot be trusted.

The documentation cites source locations by the hundred -- ``scheduler.py:236``,
``gateway.py:1193-1264`` -- and until now nothing checked a single one of them.
They are load-bearing: the project's own convention is that a claim about
behaviour points at the code that implements it, so a reader who distrusts a
sentence can go and read it. A citation that lands on unrelated code is worse
than an absent one, because the reader then tries to reconcile the wrong code
with a claim that is still true, and concludes against the claim.

Two checks, because two different things go wrong.

**The location exists.** The file resolves and the range lies inside it, which
catches a file renamed, a file deleted and a range past the end -- the damage a
refactor does, in bulk, at exactly the moment nobody is reading the
documentation. Always blocking: there is nothing to weigh.

**The range has not drifted.** Bounds alone miss the common and most
misleading case: a range that slid a few lines and still lands on real code.
Measured on ``ARCHITECTURE.md``, two citations out of three sampled were wrong
this way -- ``const.py:338-343`` given for ``EVENT_LESSON_RESTORED``, which is
at line 385 and whose cited lines carry the end of another enum; ``todo.py:71``
given for ``UPDATE_TODO_ITEM``, which is at 79 while line 71 reads
``student: Student,``. Both are well inside the file, so the first check sees
nothing, and a reader has no reason to doubt the citation rather than the
sentence.

Drift is read from history rather than content. For each citation, take a
**baseline** -- a commit at which the citation was plausibly true -- and ask
whether the *cited* file has changed at or above the end of the range since.
If it has, the range may have moved.

**The baseline is per citation, not per document**, and that distinction is the
whole accuracy of the check. Using the document's last commit means any edit
anywhere in the file silences every report against it: 145 of this project's
146 citations in one document predate its last commit, so a one-line typo fix
rebased all of them and the check went quiet having verified nothing. So the
baseline is the commit that last wrote *the line carrying the citation*, from
``git blame``. Touching the document elsewhere no longer resets anything, and
rewriting the citation's own line means somebody did re-open it.

**Blocking and reporting are separated, deliberately.** On the blame baseline
this repository has a backlog of some seventy suspect citations. Failing a
change on seventy lines it did not touch is not a gate, it is a gate that gets
switched off -- so what blocks is narrower than what is reported:

* **Blocking** -- the range may have moved *because of the commits under
  test*. That is the drift check run with ``--since=<ref>``: the author of
  those commits is the one who can act, and they are being told they just
  invalidated a citation.
* **Reporting** -- everything else the blame baseline finds. Printed as notes,
  exit code untouched, a backlog to work off rather than a wall.

**Limits, written here rather than left to a reviewer, because they decide what
this is worth.** "Not drifted" means "nothing moved above it since the
baseline", *not* "verified": a range that slid before its baseline and was
never re-opened is invisible to both checks. Re-wording the paragraph a
citation sits in resets that citation's baseline without anyone re-opening the
range -- far narrower than "touching the document", but not nothing. Neither
check judges whether the cited code is *relevant* to the claim. And nobody
should read either as licence to cite without opening the file.

Neither failure is reachable by review: a citation is correct when it is
committed, and a later commit to a *different* file is what invalidates it.
