"""Where the ``pronotepy`` pin is declared, and whether upstream moved past it.

This module exists because of an outage that lasted a morning. Every login
against one school started failing with a ``CryptoError`` that upstream labels
"probably the qr code has expired" -- a message that sends the reader after a QR
code which was, in fact, perfectly valid. The real cause was on the server
side: the establishment's PRONOTE had been upgraded to 26.2.5, and the pinned
``pronotepy==2.15.6`` predates the three-line rewrite of the challenge exchange
in ``ClientBase._login`` that upstream shipped as ``2.15.7`` under the commit
subject *"fix compatibility with PRONOTE 2026.2.5.6"*.

That release had existed for six days. Nothing in this repository said so, and
the version number alone would not have helped: what identified the cause was
the **commit subject**. So the job that uses this module reports the new
version, its date *and* the subjects between the two tags, which is the piece
of information that actually ends the investigation.

It reports them on a **pull request that raises the pin**, not on an issue.
The difference is what the maintainer gets to read: an issue says a newer
release exists, a pull request says whether it *works* -- because opening one
runs `validate.yml`, which exercises the whole suite and `mypy --strict`
against the new library on both socles. On the day of the outage that evidence
would have been available within minutes of upstream publishing, instead of
requiring somebody to reproduce the install by hand. What the pull request
cannot do is discharge the rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md` §5 -- every divergence
documented in ``hardened_client.py`` has to be re-read against the new version
by a human -- so nothing here merges anything.

Three design points worth keeping:

* the pinned version is **read**, never restated. It is already written twice
  --- ``requirements_test.txt`` is what CI tests against, ``manifest.json`` is
  what Home Assistant installs on a user's instance --- and a third copy inside
  a workflow would be a third thing to forget on the day the pin moves;
* those two copies are checked **against each other**. They can diverge in
  silence, and a divergence means the suite is not exercising the library users
  actually run. ``scripts/check_manifest.py`` makes that assertion on every
  push; this module holds the parser it uses;
* the bump itself lives here rather than in the workflow, as a text
  substitution over the two files, so it is unit-tested instead of being a
  ``sed`` line in YAML that nothing ever runs until the day it matters.

Standard library only, and every network call injectable: the unit tests in
``tests/test_pronotepy_pin.py`` run inside a suite that blocks sockets.

Usage::

    python scripts/pronotepy_pin.py                     # print the agreed pin
    python scripts/pronotepy_pin.py --check-upstream    # compare against PyPI
    python scripts/pronotepy_pin.py --bump 2.15.7       # move both declarations
