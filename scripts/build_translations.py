"""Generate ``strings.json`` and the translation catalogues from one table.

Written as a generator rather than three hand-maintained JSON files because
§10.5 requires a test asserting that every key present in one language exists
in the others, with the same placeholders. Hand-editing three files keeps that
test permanently red for uninteresting reasons; generating them from a single
table makes the test a real check on the *table* instead.

``strings.json`` is the English source of truth (§10.1), ``translations/en.json``
is its copy, and ``translations/fr.json`` carries the French. Nothing
user-visible is hard-coded anywhere in ``custom_components/`` -- that is what
the accompanying test verifies.

Run: ``python scripts/build_translations.py``
